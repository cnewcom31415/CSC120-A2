Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    What worked:
        -Using the sample code as a template to modify helped a lot to speed up the process
        -Doing lots and lots of testing of normal and edge cases to make sure everything was
         working how I expected it to

    What didn't work:
        -Sample code differed from what was needed in oo, so there was a lot of debugging involved
         to try and get it to work how I expected it to.
        -I wish I had looked at the given main method a bit more closely. Especially the examples
         of how the code should run. I ran it once and saw how it worked, but I wish I had modified
         it a bit to really look at the inner workings. I feel like that would have helped with
         all the debugging

    My Advice:
        -Commenting out your variables at the start saves a lot of time at the end, and
         can sometimes give you a clearer view of what you have to do in your methods.
